# Machine Learning  

##Support vector Machine for Clasifications problem 
support vector machine is one of the popular ML models for 
Clasification Problemes 

## Overview
This is simple  code for the "Classifying Data using a Support Vector Machine" 
My data was just some random arrays that i've created , so the reason behind this code
is to understand how SVM works  .


## Dependencies
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Usage
Just run by  `python demo.py` in terminal.
